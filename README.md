# StableRoommate
This repository contains C++ codes for various functionalities related to the stable roommate problem
## Solver
- Using the solver compile the solver with the command

         g++ Stable_Roommate_solver.cpp
- To execute the solver use the command

        ./a.out <name_of_input_file>.txt <name_of_output_file>.txt
- The input file must be like the one shown in Sample_test_case.txt and the output file must be empty
- If there exists a stable matching the solver fills the output file with a possible matching otherwise it says no matching is possible

## Checker
- Given a preference list and a solution the code check if the solution is indeed a valid solution
- Using the solver compile the solver with the command

         g++ Stable_Roommate_checker.cpp
- To execute the solver use the command

        ./a.out <name_of_preference_list_file>.txt <name_of_matching_file>.txt
        
## Test Generators
Its a sequence of codes which generate different kinds of input:-
- An input which guarantees O(n^2) time for phase 1
- An input which guarantees O(n^2) time for phase 2
- A random input with complete preference lists
- A random input with incomplete preference lists
